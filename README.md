# EDA-on-Haberman-s-Survival-Data-Set

Dataset Description: The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.  

  * Number of Attributes: 4 (including the class attribute) 
  * Attribute Information:  
            
      a. Age of patient at the time of operation (numerical)           
      b. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)           
      c. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)           
      d. Survival status (class attribute)     
      
           1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer                        
           2 = the patient died within 5 year  

Objective / Tasks: Perform an "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" for the "Haberman's Survival Dataset" to determine the best feature of the 2 classifications that can be used to predict the survival status of a new patient with the given below sections:       

   1. Import Libraries      
   2. Load Dataset      
   3. Data Insights (i.e. number of points, number of features, number of classes, data-points per class)      
   4. Data Visualization for better understanding of the Dataset      
   5. Perform Univariate analysis (PDF, CDF, Boxplot, Violin plots) to understand which features are useful towards classification      
   6. Perform Bi-variate analysis (Scatter plots, Pair-plots) to see if combinations of features are useful in the classification      
   7. Perform Multi-variate analysis (Contour-plot) to see if combinations of features are useful in the classification      
   8. Additional statistics on independent variables (i.w. mean, std, percentiles, median, IDR, MAD, Quantiles)      
   9. Conclusions      
   10. References
